# The chromosomes_unit value is used as a unit (suffix "u") to shorten
# values in other parts of the configuration file. Some parameters,
# such as ideogram and tick spacing, accept "u" suffixes, so instead of
#
# spacing = 10000000
#
# you can write
#
# spacing = 10u
#
# See ticks.conf for examples.

## *** The actual connections between chromosomes ***
# Links are defined in <link> blocks enclosed in a <links> block. The
# links start at a radial position defined by 'radius' and have their
# control point (adjusts curvature) at the radial position defined by
# 'bezier_radius'. In this example, I use the segmental duplication
# data set, which connects regions of similar sequence (90%+
# similarity, at least 1kb in size).

<links>

<link>

# Any links that are intra-chromosomal will not be shown. Further rules are not tested.

<plot> 

# The type sets the format of the track.

type = highlight

# The track is confined within r0/r1 radius limits. When using the
# relative "r" suffix, the values are relative to the position of the
# ideogram.

# Three tracks
r1   = 0.93r
r0   = 0.955r

# Histograms can have both a fill and outline. The default outline is 1px thick black.

# To turn off default outline, set the outline thickness to zero. If
# you want to permanently disable this default, edit
# etc/tracks/histogram.conf in the Circos distribution.

# thickness = 0p
stroke_thickness = 0p

# A histogram can be oriented out or in.

### ---- The gene track ----
