chromosomes_units = 50000

# The chromosomes_unit value is used as a unit (suffix "u") to shorten
# values in other parts of the configuration file. Some parameters,
# such as ideogram and tick spacing, accept "u" suffixes, so instead of
#
# spacing = 10000000
#
# you can write
#
# spacing = 10u
#
# See ticks.conf for examples.

<<include ticks.conf>> # Settings for the ticks 
# ------------------------------
# Make the chr size different
# Relative scale defines the size of the ideogram relative to image circumference
# 0.25 is 25% of figure
# chromosomes_scale   = PaWa137m_SpokBlock=0.25r
chromosomes_scale   = PaWa137m_SpokBlock:50 # This makes it explicitly 50 times bigger


# The default radial position for all ideograms is set by 'radius' in
# the <ideogram> block (see ideogram.conf). To change the value for
# specific ideograms, use chromosomes_radius.

chromosomes_radius  = PaWa137m_SpokBlock:0.95r

# ------------------------------
## *** The actual connections between chromosomes ***
# Links are defined in <link> blocks enclosed in a <links> block. The
# links start at a radial position defined by 'radius' and have their
# control point (adjusts curvature) at the radial position defined by
# 'bezier_radius'. In this example, I use the segmental duplication
# data set, which connects regions of similar sequence (90%+
# similarity, at least 1kb in size).
