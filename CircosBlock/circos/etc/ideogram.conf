# The <ideogram> block defines the position, size, labels and other
# properties of the segments on which data are drawn. These segments
# are usually chromosomes, but can be any integer axis.

# Spacing between ideograms. Suffix "r" denotes a relative value. It
# is relative to circle circumference (e.g. space is 0.5% of
# circumference).
